In this project, I'm building out a non-trivial application from end-to-end.

The idea on a technical level is relatively simple, it's just a URL shortener, however I'm doing EVERYTHING in the process myself. 

That means UI/UX design, storyboarding, systems design, implementation, deployment and hosting - the whole kit and caboodle. 

Why? A few reasons. 

Throughout my career as a developer, I've tended to work on parts of systems rather than creating systems entirely from scratch (this is probably the case for most developers).

I do think there is something to be gained from doing that "Zero to One" journey, seeing everything come together from nothing.

I think in between the cracks of all the steps it takes to bring an application to life is a tremendous space for learning.

It will get me out of thinking like a developer who is working on a specific piece of an application to a developer bringing a product to life. 

I'm also using it to sharpen up on a few skills:
- Learning the Adonis.js framework. 
- Building basic skills in UI / UX and storyboarding. (This bit is AI assisted)
- Data design from scratch (Instead of modifying an existing data model, creating one for a new application)
- "Non Academic" system design - thinking about a solution to a problem, realizing that solution, and having to own the mistakes rather than it all being on paper.
- Learning more about infrastructure and hosting, stepping outside the comfort of just the application layer.
- Finally, learning to use AI models to speed up implementation (not outsourcing the thinking to AI, however)
